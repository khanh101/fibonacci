# FIBONACCI

Calculating the 50,000,000-th Fibonacci number in < 1 second.
The implementation using Binet's formula and calculation in $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{5}]$ inspired by a video from SheafificationOfG [https://github.com/SheafificationOfG/Fibsonicci](https://github.com/SheafificationOfG/Fibsonicci)

Note: by removing $\psi^n$, it can calculate up to the 80,000,000-th Fibonacci number, but the code is so nice that I don't want to change it
